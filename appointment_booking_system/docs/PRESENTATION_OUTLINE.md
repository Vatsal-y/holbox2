# Presentation / Demo Outline

## 1. Title Slide
- Project Name: Intelligent Appointment Booking System
- Your Name / Team Name
- Date

## 2. Introduction / Problem Statement (1-2 slides)
- The challenge of traditional appointment booking.
- Our solution: An AI-powered, voice-first system.
- Target audience: Users seeking appointments, service providers.

## 3. Key Features & Solution Overview (2-3 slides)
- **Voice-First Interface:** Natural language for bookings (show concept/simulated interaction).
- **Smart Scheduling:** AI-optimized slot selection based on availability and preferences.
- **Agentic AI Integration:** Learning user preferences, historical patterns.
- **(Conceptual) Agent-to-Agent Communication:** Dynamic conflict resolution.
- **Real-Time Notifications:** Email confirmations, reminders, cancellations.

## 4. System Architecture (1-2 slides)
- High-level diagram: User Interface (Voice/Web) -> Backend API (FastAPI) -> Core Services (Scheduler, AI, Notifications) -> Database (PostgreSQL - conceptual).
- Key Technologies: Python, FastAPI, (Simulated STT/TTS), Pytest.

## 5. Live Demo / Scenario Walkthrough
### Scenario 1: User Signup & Login
  - Show `POST /auth/signup` via API docs.
  - Show `POST /auth/login` and receiving JWT.
  - Show `GET /auth/users/me` using the token.
### Scenario 2: Checking Provider Availability
  - Show `POST /providers/{provider_id}/availability` via API docs.
  - Input: `provider_id`, `target_date`, `service_type` (for AI duration), `user_id` (for AI preferences).
  - Output: List of available time slots.
  - Demonstrate how changing `service_type` or `target_date` affects results.
### Scenario 3: Booking an Appointment
  - Show `POST /appointments` via API docs (using token from login).
  - Input: `provider_id`, `start_time`, `end_time` (chosen from availability).
  - Output: Confirmed appointment details.
  - Show (simulated) email notification (console output from local SMTP server).
### Scenario 4: Viewing User's Appointments
  - Show `GET /appointments/user/{user_id}` via API docs.
### Scenario 5: Cancelling an Appointment
  - Show `PUT /appointments/{appointment_id}/cancel` via API docs.
  - Show updated status and (simulated) cancellation email.

## 6. Code Highlights / Technical Details (1-2 slides)
- FastAPI endpoint example (`providers_router.py` or `appointments_router.py`).
- Snippet from `scheduler_service/core.py` (slot generation logic).
- Snippet from `ai_service/suggestions.py` (preference-based suggestion).
- Mention of `pytest` unit tests for backend logic.

## 7. Challenges & Learnings (1 slide)
- E.g., Designing flexible scheduling logic.
- Simulating complex AI and voice features effectively.
- Importance of clear API contracts (Pydantic).

## 8. Future Work / Next Steps (1 slide)
- Full Voice Integration (actual STT/TTS services).
- Real Database Integration (PostgreSQL).
- Complete Frontend Development (Web UI, potentially mobile).
- Advanced AI Models (machine learning for preferences, conflict prediction).
- Robust Provider-Side Management Interface.
- Scalability and Deployment.

## 9. Conclusion & Q&A (1 slide)
- Recap of project goals and achievements.
- Thank you / Questions.
